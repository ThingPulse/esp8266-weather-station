## Why A Library?

I realized that more and more the **Weather Station** <br>
was becoming a general framework for displaying <br>
data over **WiFi** to one of these pretty displays.

<br>

#### What Was Needed

However everyone would have different ways or <br>
sources for data and as such, the important part <br>
of the library would rather be the classes that <br>
fetch the data, than the main class.

<br>

#### Data Fetchers

In case you wrote a data fetcher that might be <br>
of interest to others and you would like it to be <br>
integrated in this library, simply contact me.

Otherwise you might also want to offer your code <br>
as extension library yourself and call it something <br>
like `ESP8266-Weather-Station-< Your Service >`

***We will gladly list it as third party library.***
